                    <h3>Data Processing Pipeline</h3>
                    <p>Over <b>41 gigabytes</b> of raw text data were analyzed for the purposes of this project. The functional programming language <code>OCaml</code> was used due to its highly expressive syntax, incredible speed, and top-notch power.</p>
                <img src="images/pipeline.png" />

                    <p>That's over <b>100 million</b> (102,696,714 to be exact) deaths analyzed&mdash;records exist for every person who officially died in the United States from 1968 up to 2014.</p>
                    <p>Many thanks to the US Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for this fantastic dataset.</p>
                    <div class="note"><b>Note: </b>The data comes in three different formats, corresponding to different revisions of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) encoding scheme. This made crunching the data somewhat more difficult but did not prove to be an insurmountable roadblock.</div>

          <div class="info">
                    <p>For each visualization, the data was sytematically read, crunched, reshaped, and saved to the disk as JSON files which directly translate to the data plotted using the javascript libraries <code>Cytoscape.js</code> and <code>Plotly.js</code>.</p>
                    <p>An example pipeline is as follows:</p>
                <img src="images/example_pipeline.png" />

                    <p>The data is first read into a list. This list is then passed through transformation functions that sequentially condense and extract the desired data for plotting.</p>
                    <p>After the transformations are complete, the list is rendered as JSON and saved out, where it is retrieved at a later time by the frontend scripts that render the visualizations.</p>
                    <p>Depending on how much data was used for any given visualization, processing took anywhere from 30 seconds to roughly 15 minutes.</p>
