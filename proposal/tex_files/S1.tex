\section{Introduction}

For the \texttt{STAT 3622} final project I propose a data visualization of mortality data gathered from the United States' Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC provides extensive records of deaths in the US from 1968 up to 2014: the dataset includes cause of death, location of death, age at time of death, sex, race, pre-existing conditions, and many more elements. Access to data this detailed provides countless opportunities for analysis and visualization of mortality in the United States.

The data is released in a raw format that would require a non-trivial amount of processing to prepare it for analysis. As a computer science student with nearly 10 years of programming experience and data manipulation, I believe that I am capable of handling this task and that the format of the data will not prove an insurmountable hinderance for the project.

However, given that the data is provided in year-by-year releases, all with slightly different schema, it is not realistic to analyze each of the years in the hopes of producing time-series data for the last four decades. Rather, focus will be placed on the 1968 and 2014 datasets, examining state- and country-wide differences in cause, age, location, etc. of death for Americans.

Various visualizations focused on different characteristics from the dataset will be produced. See the following section for a more detailed outline of the proposed graphics.
