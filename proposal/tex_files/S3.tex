\section{Final Remarks}

Mortality is a topic that every one of us must grapple with throughout our lives. Through a data-driven inspection of this inevitable event I hope to remove some of the mystery surrounding death, providing viewers with a more complete idea of the methods in which they may meet their demise.

The visualizations discussed in \textsc{Section 2} may not comprise the exact set of visualizations presented along with the final submission; during the data preparation process I will use my discretion to decide which proposed figures should be removed and which additional figures should be created and included.
